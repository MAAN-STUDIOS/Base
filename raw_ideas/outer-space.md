## **Galaxy Navigation: Ship Travel**

### üéØ Purpose / Design Goal

Introduce a seamless transition between localized exploration (space stations, planets) and large-scale travel (space
navigation) while keeping the same core perspective. This supports immersion, sense of distance, and strategic
decision-making on where to go next.

> Goal: Create a sense of scale and freedom while maintaining technical and visual consistency.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Description

When the player exits a station or planet, they automatically enter their personal spaceship. The camera remains
top-down, but the **scale shifts** dramatically: space bases, planets, asteroid fields, and derelict ships are now much
smaller on screen, simulating a "zoomed-out" galaxy travel mode.

- The ship is controlled similarly to the player (WASD, momentum).
- Encounters, signals, and space hazards can appear mid-travel.
- Reaching a destination allows the player to exit the ship and **‚Äúzoom in‚Äù** back into normal-scale exploration mode.

Transitions are instant (or masked with a short fade-in/out or cockpit animation), keeping the gameplay smooth.

### üéÆ Gameplay Impact

- **Encourages exploration** of multiple points of interest on a galactic map.
- **Introduces travel tension**: some routes may be blocked, patrolled by Flood ships, or contain hazards like mines or
  radiation zones.
- **Supports fast travel-like mechanics** while retaining full control and agency.
- Adds **spatial awareness**‚Äîplayers must manage where they go and what paths are safe or worth exploring.
- Enables **resource decision-making** (e.g., fuel or ship repair kits could be added).

### üí¨ Narrative / World Integration

The ship is a relic from the protagonist's past, the last functional ship left in the hangar,
half-buried in dust. After awakening and uncovering scattered logs about the fate of the crew, the protagonist follows
a trail of hints leading to this damaged ship.

Restoring the ship becomes the first tangible objective:

- **Collect missing parts**
- **Reboot its damaged systems**
- **Recover memory fragments from its AI core**

During this process, the player uncovers personal echoes, old mission files, conversations, encrypted logs. Slowly
tying their identity to the ship. Once fixed, the ship unlocks **galaxy navigation**, marking a pivotal shift in the
game: the ability to explore beyond the current station and seek answers across the stars.

This ties narrative and mechanic tightly: the ship isn‚Äôt just a vehicle‚Äîit‚Äôs a key to the story, a metaphor for recovery
and discovery.
